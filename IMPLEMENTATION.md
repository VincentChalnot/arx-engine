# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

This implementation adds Docker Compose support for serving the Arx Engine web interface with a configurable server URL.

### 1. Modified JavaScript to Read Server URL from Meta Tag

**File: `public/app.js`**

Changed from hardcoded server URL:
```javascript
const SERVER_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000';
```

To dynamic reading from meta tag with fallback:
```javascript
let SERVER_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'; // Default fallback
const metaServerUrl = document.querySelector('meta[name="server-url"]');
if (metaServerUrl) {
    SERVER_URL = metaServerUrl.content;
}
```

### 2. Created Nginx Configuration

**File: `nginx.conf`**

- Serves static files from `/usr/share/nginx/html` (mounted from `./public`)
- Uses `sub_filter` to inject a meta tag into the HTML with the server URL
- The placeholder `SERVER_URL_PLACEHOLDER` is replaced at runtime by Docker Compose

### 3. Created Dockerfile for Rust Server

**File: `Dockerfile`**

Multi-stage build:
- **Builder stage**: Uses `rust:1.83-alpine` with musl-dev to compile the server binary
- **Runtime stage**: Uses minimal `alpine:latest` with just the compiled binary
- Result: Small, secure container with statically-linked binary

### 4. Created Docker Compose Configuration

**File: `compose.yaml`**

Two services:
- **nginx**: Serves the public folder and injects server URL from environment variable
  - Port 8080 exposed to host
  - Reads `SERVER_URL` from environment (defaults to `http://server:3000`)
  
- **server**: Builds and runs the Rust server
  - Port 3000 exposed to host
  - Built using the Dockerfile

### 5. Supporting Files

- **`.env.example`**: Documents the `SERVER_URL` environment variable
- **`DOCKER.md`**: Complete testing guide and troubleshooting
- **`validate-setup.sh`**: Automated validation script
- **Updated `README.md`**: Added Docker Compose instructions
- **Updated `.gitignore`**: Added `.env` to prevent committing secrets

## How It Works

1. User starts services with `docker compose up`
2. Docker Compose reads `SERVER_URL` from environment (or uses default)
3. Nginx container starts and runs a sed command to replace `SERVER_URL_PLACEHOLDER` in nginx.conf with the actual URL
4. When a browser requests index.html, nginx's `sub_filter` injects the meta tag
5. JavaScript reads the meta tag and uses it for API calls

## Usage

### Basic usage (services communicate via Docker network):
```bash
docker compose up --build
# Access at http://localhost:8080
# Server URL will be http://server:3000 (internal)
```

### For external access from the browser:
```bash
echo "SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000" > .env
docker compose up --build
# Access at http://localhost:8080
# Server URL will be http://localhost:3000 (accessible from browser)
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Static Files Only in Public Folder**: nginx serves only static HTML/JS/CSS
2. **No Custom Nginx Dockerfile Needed**: Uses official nginx:alpine image
3. **Configurable via Environment**: Easy to change server URL without rebuilding
4. **Minimal Rust Container**: Multi-stage build keeps runtime image small
5. **No Hardcoded URLs**: JavaScript reads configuration at runtime
6. **Development and Production Ready**: Works for both local development and deployed environments

## Network Topology

```
Browser (localhost:8080)
    ↓
Nginx Container (port 80)
    - Serves public/index.html with injected meta tag
    - Serves public/app.js
    ↓
JavaScript reads meta tag
    ↓
Makes API calls to SERVER_URL
    ↓
Rust Server Container (port 3000)
```

## Requirements Met

✅ Public folder served by nginx (static files only)
✅ Server URL configured via custom header (implemented as meta tag)
✅ Header value from environment variable
✅ compose.yaml with nginx and Rust services
✅ No custom Dockerfile for nginx
✅ Rust server in minimal Alpine container
✅ Multi-stage build compiling with musl (libc)
