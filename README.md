## @todo

[x] Make King effectively not stackable
[ ] King capture stops the game
[ ] When a move can be either full stack or unstack: show a dialog to confirm (default full stack)

[ ] Show captured pieces and corresponding points (exact values to define)
[ ] Allow computer to search game tree to evalutate the position using MCT
